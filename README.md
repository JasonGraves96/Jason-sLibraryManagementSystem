Created for my Software Development I class at Valencia College
To use this program right click the "Graves SDLC Assignment" folder and open it as an Intellij project
Then hit the run arrow and the rest should be fairly straightforward

This program stores books. You are able to enter in books manually, or by typing them into the "newbooks.txt" file inside. Stick with the format the sample books use, for example
1,To Kill a Mockingbird,Harper Lee
seperate the number, title, and author with a comma. No spaces, unless you want them included with the title or author

This program is also able to save custom libraries with a .liby extention.
These files are saved inside the out/production/Graves SDLC Assignment directory. There is no way to delete these files from within the program, it must be done in file explorer
